Started this project not knowing JavaScript very well at all, finished knowing it about 20% more lol. I am going to add a screen shot which I will remove later that shows all the things I tried in greyed out section just so you can see how much I tried to get this to work! This project has been very frustrating but rewarding seeing it work in the end.

I originally was going to do like 3 html screens one for the start page, one for the questions and one for input. But after a while I thought to just do one and use javascript hide and display features would be easier, not sure if that is the case. I was motivated to do this because I really need this to click and make more sense to me. It is starting to make more sense but the more I do it will get a little easier. Only thing I have not got done is setting up the local storage, and at this point I'm worried I'll mess up something, I will add it later.


## Installation

Using github pages I am able to get the webpage going and deployed, doing this now a few times it has got easier for me to figure out.

## Credits

I had help from two of the TA Matt, and Henry who helped get me in the right direction. Had a tutor Andres help me also to get some bugs worked out and explained how some of the things were working. Also Joel from class we did a few zoom calls talking through a lot of stuff together. I used W3Schools, mnd, and google to get some ideas of what I needed or how to structure a function.
